# Patient Monitoring System

Real-time Remote Health Monitoring System are useful due to the possibility of timely and efficient healthcare services. These systems are based on wearable sensors & advanced wireless technologies. The continuous growth in technology has remarkably enhanced the scope of real-time remote health monitoring systems which is developed considering the cost, ease of application, accuracy, and data security. The system is conceptualized to provide an interface between the doctor and the patients for two-way communication. The main purpose of this study is to facilitate the remote cardiac patients in getting latest healthcare services which might not be possible otherwise due to low doctor-to-patient ratio

• In today’s healthcare practice, Doctors have a need to monitor more than one medical parameter from patients. We need device that it should allow doctors to view the measured parameters over long period of time for analysis.

• If doctors can get these parameters wirelessly, it is very useful for both patients and doctor.

• Our Project is Real-time Wireless Health Monitor System. This system based on long distant wireless technology.

• It displays the result of these to the doctor through LCD display and Mobile app using GPRS Technology.
